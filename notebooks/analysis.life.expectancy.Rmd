## Analysis of Life Expectancy by Continent

We hypothesize that life expectancy is a function of time and location. This analysis attempts to check that relationship.

**Note: This is a preliminary analysis and not meant for distribution to the public.**

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# read in the data
d<-readr::read_csv(here("data/gapminder/raw/gapminder_data.csv"))

# make a plot of population over time
ggplot(data=d) +geom_line(aes(x=year, y= pop, group = country,
                              color = country))
```
